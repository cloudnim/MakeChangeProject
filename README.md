# Make Change Project

## Week 1 Homework for Skill Distillery Cohort SD15

This program will imitate a cash register. It will accept an input of the item price,
the amount tendered, and then calculate the correct amount of change. Specifically it
will return the amount of change in the largest denomination type needed (eg. if your 
change was $11 dollars, it would return 1 x $10 dollar bill and 1 x $1 dollar bill, not
11 x $1 dollar bills).


## Getting Started

These instructions will explains how to set up the project on your local machine, and then run the code for evaluation and further development. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
[Java Development Kit 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) - Initial development was completed on JDK 1.8U162

Terminal/Shell access (Linux terminal, OSX terminal, Windows PowerShell)
```

### Installing

To get Make Change up and running you need to copy the source code from the "MakeChangeProject".

To download the source code navigate to the link below:

```
[MakeChange](https://github.com/cloudnim/MakeChangeProject) - Project Repository
```

Clone the Make Change repository following the instructions "Cloning a repository"

```
[Cloning a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
```

Once you have successfully cloned the repository to your local machine open up a terminal/shell and run the following commands to compile and run the program.

```
# Navigate to the src/ directory where you cloned the repository
cd <your directory path where you cloned the repository to>/src

eg: cd ~/MakeChange/src

# Compile the java file
javac com/skilldistillery/makechange/MakeChangeApp

# Run the program 
java com/skilldistillery/makechange/MakeChangeApp
```

## Running the tests

Note that this is a beginner programmer's code and is version 1.0. The program executes once and exits after results are given. 

You must rerun the "java java com/skilldistillery/makechange/MakeChangeApp" command each time you wish to test it. 

Perhaps version 1.5 or 2.0 will be undertaken and add a while condition check to keep it going until you choose to exit. Ideas are on the whiteboard.
